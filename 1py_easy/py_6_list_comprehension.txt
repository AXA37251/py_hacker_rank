# Let's learn about list comprehensions! You are given three integers x, y and z representing the dimensions of a cuboid along with an integer n.
# Print a list of all possible coordinates given by (i, j , k) on a 3D grid where the sum of i + j + k is not equal to n.
# Here, 0 <= i <= x; 0 <= j <= y; 0 <= k <= z; Please use list comprehensions rather than multiple loops, as a learning excercise.

# Four integers x, y, z and n, each on a separate line.
# Print the list in lexicographic increasing order.

x = 1
y = 1
z = 2
n = 3
